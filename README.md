## Description

Grass is the worst type in the game. Steel has too many resistances. And Dragon lost its luster when Fairy was introduced. Do you think you can do a better job rebalancing the types? This tool lets you do that.

## Features

- Click on a cell to recycle through the available damage effectiveness.
- Click on a type icon to zero that row.
- Download your chart as csv. Upload it to restore your work.
- The stats for the types automatically update as the chart is changed.
